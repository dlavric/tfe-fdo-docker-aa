```

- Export AWS environment variables
```shell
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=
export AWS_REGION= 
```

- Download all the Terraform dependencies for modules and providers
```shell
terraform init
```

- Verify the output is successfull
```shell
Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Reusing previous version of hashicorp/tls from the dependency lock file
- Reusing previous version of hashicorp/aws from the dependency lock file
- Reusing previous version of vancluever/acme from the dependency lock file
- Using previously-installed hashicorp/tls v4.0.5

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
```

- Apply all the changes
```shell
terraform apply
```

- Verify the output matches in number of resources
```shell
Plan: 26 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
```

- Wait a couple of minutes for TFE to become online

- Access the TFE environment at the following URL: https://daniela-docker1.tf-support.hashicorpdemo.com

- Destroy you infrastructure
```shell
terraform destroy
```

- Verify the output matches in number of resources
```shell
